## Introduction

Identifying individuals with alcohol consumption patterns is crucial for preventive healthcare and intervention strategies. In this project, we leverage health data and predictive modelling techniques to develop algorithms that can accurately predict alcohol consumption patterns in individuals.

## Features

- Overview of the predictive modelling approach for identifying alcohol consumption patterns.
- Implementation of various machine learning and statistical models for predictive modelling.
- Example code notebook (`predictive_modelling.ipynb`) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Evaluation metrics and techniques for assessing the performance of predictive models.

## Installation

To get started with the report, code notebook, and dataset for predictive modelling, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code notebook (`model.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform. Follow along with the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
3. Read the report (`Report.pdf`) provided in the root directory.

## Dataset

The dataset (`dataset.zip`) containing health data for predictive modelling is provided in the root directory. Extract the dataset before running the code notebook.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, encounter any issues, or want to add new features, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
